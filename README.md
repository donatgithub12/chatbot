# chatbot
Developed a chatbot for an Ed-Tech website using Python, ChatterBot, and Flask.
Designed the chatbot to assist users by providing relevant responses to educational queries based on a pre-defined Q&A dataset.
Implemented text cleaning and preprocessing techniques using cleaner3.py to enhance the accuracy of the chatbot.
Used string similarity matching (difflib.get_close_matches) to find the closest responses to user queries.
Integrated the chatbot seamlessly into the website, ensuring smooth interaction and quick response times.
Improved the chatbot's performance by training it on edu_chat.txt, a dataset containing various educational queries and answers.
Applied web development skills to build a user-friendly interface for the chatbot using HTML and CSS. UI3.html is the user interface
